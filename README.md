# Harry-Potter-and-The-Prisoner-Of-Azkaban-PC-Fps-Fix
This is the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban PC game FPS fix/ limiter

IMPORTANT READ THE READ ME FILE INCLUDED WITH THE DOWNLOAD

These Launchers simply patch the game using the internal logic to put a cap on fps to solve issues inside the game relating to fps being to high such as the imp glitch with no way to limit it.

you can choose from 60 or 120 fps launchers 

Simply go to release and download the zip file and put HP3-120FPSLauncher.exe or HP3-60FPSLauncher.exe OR BOTH into the games install location next to hppoa.exe (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban PC exe) 

use whichever launcher to run the game for whichever desired fps in game you wish to have. (double click the HP3-120FPSLauncher.exe or HP3-60FPSLauncher.exe to run the game with that chosen fps limit)

if you wish you can create a shortcut from these onto your desktop to run the game from that.
