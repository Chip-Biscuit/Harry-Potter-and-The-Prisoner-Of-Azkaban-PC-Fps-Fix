# Requirements before using fix
IMPORTANT READ THE READ ME FILE INCLUDED WITH THE DOWNLOAD BEFORE USING THE FIX.

# Information on the fix
These launchers simply patch the game using the internal logic to put a 60fps or 120fps cap on in order to solve issues inside of the game relating to fps being too high (such as the frozen Imp glitch), as there is not proper way to limit it.

# Instructions
Go to releases and download the latest version of the HP3-FPS-Cap-Game-Launchers.zip. Then choose either the HP3-120FPSLauncher.exe or HP3-60FPSLauncher.exe and extract the one you wish to use into your games system folder next to the hppoa.exe file and you are good to go! 

Use the launcher that’s suitable for your desired FPS by clicking either the HP3-120FPSLauncher.exe or HP3-60FPSLauncher.exe to run the game at the chosen FPS limit.

You can now use either the HP3-120FPSLauncher.exe or HP3-60FPSLauncher.exe files to run the game now instead of the normal hppoa.exe file. If you wish you can make a shortcut for the HP3-120FPSLauncher.exe or HP3-60FPSLauncher.exe on your desktop.
